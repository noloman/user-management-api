## Feature Summaries

### OAuth2 / Social Login

Go beyond local JWT: let users sign up/login via Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc. using Spring Security's OAuth2 client.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Add time-based one-time password (TOTP) support—for example, using Google Authenticator.

### GraphQL Endpoint

Expose user management features via a GraphQL endpoint as an alternative API style.

### API Rate Limiting/Quota Per User
Implement rate-limiting on a per-user basis (not just global or IP-based).

### Feature Flagging/Toggles

Use Togglz, LaunchDarkly, or custom DB flags to enable/disable features dynamically.

### Soft Deletes & Record Recovery
Support “soft deleting” users (mark as archived/deactivated) and add a recovery/restore API.

### End-to-End Encryption

Store highly sensitive user data securely in the database, using real encryption—not just hashing.

### Custom Actuator Endpoints

Write your own `/actuator/` endpoints for custom business metrics (user registrations this week, failed logins, etc.).

### Advanced Security Auditing

Log critical security-related events and expose audit logs via REST for compliance and review.

### Email Templates & HTML Emails

Use Thymeleaf or FreeMarker to generate rich, personalized HTML emails for verification and other flows.

### Request Tracing & Observability

Integrate distributed tracing tools (Zipkin, Jaeger, Spring Cloud Sleuth) to visualize and debug multi-service flows.

### API Client Libraries

Auto-generate API client libraries (TypeScript, Python) from OpenAPI specs for easier API consumption.

### User/Role Hierarchies

Implement more complex role relationships (inheritance) using Spring Security's `RoleHierarchy`.

### Custom Spring Boot Starter

Build and publish your own reusable Spring Boot starter for core features, sharing across services or teams.

### Internationalization (i18n)

Localize error messages and API responses, and provide multi-language email support.
